It begins  with  searching  for \\nthe source  of a problem  and ends  with  finding  the solution  for that problem  to ensure  that \\nthe product  or process  functions  properly.

Understanding the laws of heat transfer and how they affect the \\noperation of a refrigeration system allows you to proceed confidently when diagnosing and \\ncorrecting system problems. Eliminating the \"mystery\" behind the refrigeration cycle is one of \\nthe building blocks in the foundation of good troubleshooting skills. Identifying the four basic \\ncomponents within a refrigeration system and knowing how they do their job is another. \\n \\nUnderstanding these concepts, and being able to apply this information in the field, is one \\nelement of the difference between a skilled technician who is able to effectively evaluate the \\noperation of a refrigeration system and accomplish any necessary repairs or adjustments, and a\\n\\nii Different people think differently, and what may seem to be the wrong place to begin \\ntroubleshooting a given problem for one person, may be the right place for another.
